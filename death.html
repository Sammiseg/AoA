      <p>
        Ruin. It’s the only word that can describe this disgrace of rock that
        was laid out before him. Nothing more than rubble lay for miles around,
        the earth scorched, blackened trees littered about, branches turned to
        boney fingers stretched towards the sky. Wastelands are nothing new to
        him, this land was just one more. One more notch on the belt, one more
        step, one more name on the list. Just another call from someone who
        needed a guide. As he “stood” upon the red clay, he took just a moment
        to remember what it felt like to rest on warm dirt with a blanket of
        shade from an elder Redwood tree. Of course, if he wished he could
        materialize a solid form, one of whatever size or shape he desired, but
        it took so much energy. Energy he had no desire to spend when he was
        needed elsewhere by a never ending promise.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Staying in place he closed his eyes, or where they would be if he had
        them, how does one see with no eyes to see from? He stopped asking
        questions like that a millennia ago, some things just are, it held no
        benefit to exhaust his mind running circles playing tag with
        technicalities. He focused on the call that brought him to the miserable
        landscape that stretched before him in the first place. It had been
        fairly strong, a clear beacon pulling at him. Now that he was here, it
        was still strong and seemed to be growing. Yet as he tried to pinpoint
        it, follow it to the source, it was muddled… fuzzy almost, like the air
        around him was filled with static. He spotted a faint silver glow off in
        the distance, the static he had felt initially was steadily mounting in
        pressure. He called to the soul strand, hand outstretched for it, as he
        tried to will it forwards.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It was approaching him slowly, like an old stray not quite ready to
        trust but so desperately craves it. The closer they come to him, the
        heavier the charge around him grows. An uneasy feeling settles in his
        gut, something is wrong here, and he can't quite put his finger on it…
        new was never good, not in his line of work. There were always a few
        calls that stood out from the rest, this was clearly going to be no
        exception. The air around him was humming now, vibrating with bounds of
        trapped energy. He reaches for the strand that called to him, now within
        reach, only for it to explode in his grasp. Startled, no, not startled,
        he was too old to be shaken by something unusual. A bust of light so
        bright it almost hurt flashed before him, overtaking his senses, the
        electric buzz around him finally exploding, if he had to breathe, the
        air would surely have been pushed from his lungs. Just as quickly as it
        came it was gone, a millisecond in time, in front of him now was sight
        he had yet to see before.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        They came rushing by, all shapes and sizes, pouring into the air around
        him. So many dead, rushing around him as if he were stuck in a hurricane
        of lost souls. They were pushing, pulling, lashing out, confused and
        growing in number at a rate he had not seen before. The one strand, now
        hundreds, was a tangled web of fear, hunger, anger, desperation, and
        hopelessness… So many souls, so much pain, all colored in glowing shades
        of gray. He had encountered similar effects in times of great dispute
        between clans but never has it reached such a scale. Very rarely do
        things surprise him anymore; so many lifetimes, so many tragedies, but
        this was something else. Something terrible has happened here.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        So many souls, so much pain, if he could sweat from the heat and
        pressure of them he supposes he might've been in that moment. The
        cluster still grows around him, spreading out, some bright and some
        dull, some new, some old, they flash around him. A slight brush against
        his shoulder, and a sense that someone else was there, goes all but
        un-noticed as he reaches out for the soul closest to him. With so many
        strands the choice was as simple as reaching for the one closest to him.
