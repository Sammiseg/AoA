                    <p>Hello friends! Radiant Dawn are currently OPEN for recruitment. Our pack will
                        be a safe haven for baby carnivores and our own members. We are a tight knit
                        pack and consider each other a family, are very welcoming to new people joining
                        us. We like to hold events, game and spar nights and try to keep good relations
                        with our fellow packs and herds. We are looking for recruits who like to have
                        fun, are polite and abide by ALL server rules. When wanting to apply we will
                        send you a short application and go from there. Whether you're new to the server
                        or game we will help you grow. Fighting isn't the only thing we look at with our
                        recruits. We like to keep a safe space for everyone, especially our members.
                        <br><br>

                    <h5>Hidden Leaf</h5>
                    <p>We are a safe territory for juvi and adol carnis to eat, drink, and grow so
                        long as they respect AoA and pack rules. The territory is enter/eat/drink at
                        your own risk for sub adult+ carnis and all herbis. Non members may not hunt in
                        territory nor may they KOS others in territory.
                        <br><br>
                        Territory members reserve the right to KOS at their discretion, and/or hunger
                        reasons. Make sure you announce yourself when you enter territory! Whether
                        you’re a juvi carni, adult carni, or herbi, you must announce yourself in local
                        (or global if herbi) when you’ve come to GV territory or you will be eaten for
                        dinner!
                        <br><br>
                        Dinos that overstay their welcome are also subject to being dinner! Just a
                        reminder our water refill area is KOS! If we catch people doing the quest, or
                        too near the refill area we will KOS without hesitation!

                    <p>
                        Hello! We are a semi-friendly group that call our little area of hunters
                        thicket/snake gully home. We ask everyone to ask permission to pass through or
                        quest before entering - if we run into anyone in territory that has not
                        announced themselves then we will be quick to defend. We may hunt and defend
                        territory from anyone who was not given access but we do like to have friendly
                        visitors every once and a while and may even offer help questing there. Anyone
                        working to restore the water in HT or eating from our corpse will be KOS as we
                        like to keep that to ourselves. Any non-pack gators or sachis in territory will
                        also be KOS. Babies are always welcome as long as they announce whether it be
                        carni or herbie. Drinking from our water is always allowed in-fact it is welcome
                        - we may even offer you food if you drain our lake sufficiently.

                    <h5>Void Falls</h5>
                    <p>
                        Hello everyone! We are Void Falls! We aim to be a safe haven for traveling
                        herbivores as well as Herbivores which want to make Triad their home! We aim to
                        provide an environment where herbs do not have to be constantly looking over
                        their shoulders while they are in territory. We pride ourselves in having
                        members that enjoy different playstyles. From the homebodies like myself to our
                        mark goblins and we even have our very own Attack
                        Sylvee<br>
                            ! Under normal circumstances Carnivores will not be welcome and members will
                            have KOS rights. We ask Non-members follow normal server rules unless a member
                            is online and gives the okay within territory lines. During periods where
                            membership is set to OPEN anyone who would be interested in joining the Falls
                            need only message either Beta or myself for consideration. My expectations for
                            members aren't very strict. I do expect members to abide by rules and be open to
                            discussion should something occur where they are at fault. I like to promote a
                            warm and friendly environment and expect my members to have the same mindset.
                            anyone with the intention of having anything other than an awesome time on a
                            great server will not be considered for the group should they be interested.<br>

                            We may look tasty, but snack at your own risk! This herd makes a point to locate any herbis in distress and escort them to safety, taking down any carnis that try for a nibble. We pride ourselves in maintaining good vibes and do what we can to help each other. Our home of Titan Pass/Birchwoods is aimed to be a baby sanctuary where little herbis can quest and grow in peace. All carnis are advised to go around the sanctuary or pay the ultimate price of being KOS'd.

                            Greetings! The Herbserkers Way herd aims to be a very close knit, and fun-loving bunch that are always up for an adventure! We invite all new, and veteran players to join us, and will help hatchling through adolescent herbivores to grow under our protection in, or out of territory.<br>

We are always willing to test our skills and luck out in the hotspots such as: Grand Plains or Impact Crater, honing our fighting skills for survival.<br>

Carnivores Please announce in global if you plan to come through territory. We reserve the right to KOS in our territory after one warning. We will not tolerate anyone hunting in our territory and we will defend it from invaders. If you’re feeling feisty, announce that you're near our territory border seeking a duel. Otherwise, let us know if you would like to pass through. We come not to vanquish our enemies, but to create new friendships. As you enter our domain, you may be caught up in our fun and games. Perhaps you will find a home amongst our Herd.<br>

                        <ul>
                            <li>All carnivores will be KOS when stepping foot into territory without announcing.</li>
                            <li>Carnivores must stop at territory border and ask to pass through or simply go around if you don’t wish to announce.</li>
                            <li>Please pass through immediately, you will only be given one warning to exit territory</li>
                            <li>HW territory will be a safe haven for ALL herbs, where they can quest safely in our borders. If a herd member is not on, territory is subject to normal server rules.</li>
                            <li>Only official HW members can KOS carnivores who wander into territory, however, we understand if you have to protect yourself.</li>
                            <li>Any herbs who are causing problems in territory will be asked to leave.</li>
